# alt-reddit


This project is an attempt to tackle the problem of online community moderation via natural language processing and machine learning. This repo contains a script to download data into a mongoDB database, two Jupyter Notebooks outlining my pipeline for turning reddit comment data into a clear and actionable report on community content, and a Powerpoint document outlining my key findings.


# FAQ:


Data comes from pushshift.io, Jason Baumgartner's wonderful free archive of reddit posts and comments.

For a summary of my methods, my findings, and all my visualizations, please view my attached powerpoint.
