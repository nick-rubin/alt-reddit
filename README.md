# alt-reddit


This project is an attempt to tackle the problem of online community moderation via natural language processing and machine learning. This repo contains a script to download reddit comment data into a mongoDB database, two Jupyter Notebooks outlining my pipeline for turning the comment data into a clear and actionable report on community content, and a Powerpoint document outlining my key findings. Primary key finding was that the subreddit r/The_Donald used much more divisive andinflammatory language than r/Politics, arguably warranting more active moderation and leading to its eventual ban. At the time of this project, it was not banned.


# FAQ:


Data comes from pushshift.io, Jason Baumgartner's wonderful free archive of reddit posts and comments.

Large black slides are videos of the pyLDAvis Intertopic Distance Map visualizations found in the Jupyter Notebooks. Video doesn't come across well in pdf format. Please view the attached videos documenting the LDAvis per subreddit.

For a summary of my methods, my findings, and all my visualizations, please view my attached powerpoint.
