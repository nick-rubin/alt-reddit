# alt-reddit



This project is an attempt to tackle the problem of online community moderation via natural language processing and machine learning. This repo contains two Jupyter Notebooks outlining my pipeline for turning reddit comment data into a clear and actionable report on community content, and a Powerpoint document outlining my key findings.


# FAQ:

To replicate this project, either ask me for my dataset, or download your own from https://pushshift.io/, Jason Baumgartner's wonderful free archive of reddit posts and comments.

For a summary of my methods, my findings, and all my visualizations, please view my attached powerpoint.
